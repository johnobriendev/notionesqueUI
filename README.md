## Architecture

This project demonstrates several advanced architectural patterns and best practices:

**Custom Command Pattern**
- Implemented a custom Command Pattern for managing undo/redo functionality
- Provides robust state management with full action history
- All operations (create, edit, delete, priority changes) are fully reversible

**Feature-Based Organization**
- Code organized by feature rather than file type
- Each feature contains its own components, hooks, services, and state management
- Promotes modularity and maintainability

**State Management**
- Redux Toolkit for centralized state management
- Redux async thunks for handling asynchronous operations
- Redux-Persist for selective state persistence
- Optimized selectors for performance

**Type Safety**
- Full TypeScript implementation throughout the codebase
- Strongly typed Redux store and actions
- Type-safe API calls and component props

## How to Use

Visit [esque.click](https://esque.click/) to start using the application. No installation required!

### Creating Tasks

1. Click the **"Create Task"** button in the header
2. Fill in the task details:
   - **Title** (required)
   - **Description** (optional)
   - **Status** (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
   - **Priority** (Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
   - **Custom Fields** (optional)
3. Click **"Create"** to add the task

### Managing Tasks

- **Edit a Task** - Click the "Edit" button on a task card or in the detail view
- **Delete a Task** - Click the "Delete" button on a task card or in the detail view
- **Bulk Actions** - Select multiple tasks in list view to perform actions on them

### Using Views

- Toggle between **List** and **Kanban** views using the buttons in the header
- **List View** - Sort by clicking column headers, paginate with controls at the bottom
- **Kanban View** - Drag tasks between priority columns to change their priority

### Filtering and Searching

- Use the **search box** to find tasks by title
- Use the **Status** and **Priority** dropdowns to filter tasks
- Filters work in both List and Kanban views

### Undo/Redo

- Use the **undo** and **redo** buttons in the header to revert or restore changes
- All actions (create, edit, delete, priority changes) can be undone
